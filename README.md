# Calculator with GUI

## Project 2 from [IVS](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/231042/.en) university course 2022/23

## Introduction
### Task
The task is to create a calculator with basic math operations **(+,-,*,/)**, **factorial**, **exponentiation with natural exponents** (exponents are natural numbers), **common root** (common square root), and one other function.

### Additional
* The program will consist of a library with mathematical functions (including basic operations such as +,-,* etc.), on top of which a graphical user interface will be built.
* Help message will be part of the user interface
* The program can be controlled by keyboard (minimum basic operations)
* User and program documentation will be supplied with the program
    * The user documentation will include, among other things, the **procedure for        installing and uninstalling** the program using the installer (uninstaller).
    * In addition, instructions will be given for **manual (un)installation**, i.e. the process of compiling from source, creating shortcuts (icons) and other actions performed by the installer.
* The program will be distributed open source under a license [GNU GPL v.1, 2 or 3](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).
